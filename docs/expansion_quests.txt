Special Quest Configurations:
There are certain different quest configurations that change the behavior or handling of the quest with different results.

Auto-Start Quest
An Auto-start quest will be added to the player on the first server connection.

We need to have the following parameter values to work as intended:

"QuestGiverIDs": [], //! Make sure the quest has no "QuestGiverIDs" in the array!
"IsAchivement": 0, //! Make sure the quest is not flagged as an achievement quest!
"IsGroupQuest": 0, //! Make sure the quest is not flagged as a group quest!
"PreQuestIDs": [] //! Make sure the quest has no "PreQuestIDs" in the array!
Achievement Quest
An Achievement quest will get added to the player on the first server connection but the difference here is that the player will never be notified about this quest except when he completes the quest (all quest objectives completed).

We need to have the following parameter values to work as intended:

"QuestGiverIDs": [], //! Make sure the quest has no quest giver IDs!
"IsAchivement": 1, //! Make sure the quest is flagged as an achievement quest!
"Autocomplete": 1, //! Make sure the quest is auto-completed when all quest objectives are completed!
"IsGroupQuest": 0, //! Make sure the quest is not flagged as a group quest!
"PreQuestIDs": [] //! Make sure the quest has no "PreQuestIDs" in the array!
Daily Quest
Daily quests can be completed once per day and then set on a cooldown until the server's daily quest reset happens the next day. The server's daily reset time is controlled by the quest settings [LINK TO SETTING].

We need to have the following parameter values to work as intended:

"Repeatable": 1, //! Make sure the quest is repeatable!
"IsDailyQuest": 1,
"IsWeeklyQuest": 0, //! Make sure it's only a daily or weekly quest!
Weekly Quest
Weekly quests can be completed once per week and then set on a cooldown until the server's weekly quest reset happens on the next week. The server's weekly reset time and day are controlled by the quest settings [LINK TO SETTING].

We need to have the following parameter values to work as intended:

"Repeatable": 1, //! Make sure the quest is repeatable!
"IsDailyQuest": 0, //! Make sure it's only a daily or weekly quest!
"IsWeeklyQuest": 1,

Objective Files and configuration

File Information:
You can name an objective configuration file to whatever you want as long as it has the .json file extension and is placed in the related objective configurations folder.

Main Objective Configuration Parameters:
"ConfigVersion"
Integer.

Current config file version. NEVER CHANGE THIS!

"ID"
Integer.

Unique objective ID. Make sure this ID is different for every single objective in this objective category! You can use the same ID for a different objective configuration in a different objective category but never use the same ID in the same category twice!

"ObjectiveType"
Integer.

Objective Type of this objective configuration. As every objective type uses and handles different parameters and values we need to tell the system what kind of objective this is. It always needs to be the category where the config file is located.

TARGET = 2
TRAVEL = 3
COLLECT = 4
DELIVERY = 5
TREASUREHUNT = 6
AIPATROL = 7
AICAMP = 8
AIVIP = 9
ACTION = 10
CRAFTING = 11
There are different objective types that all do something different when added to a quest and every objective has a different configuration depending on the objective type:

TARGET = Quest player/s will need to kill a certain amount of mobs/players. (Optional: With a special weapon).
TRAVEL = Quest player/s will need to go to location XY.
COLLECT = Quest player/s will need to collect/find a certain amount of items.
DELIVERY = The Quest player/s will need to deliver given items to a certain position and NPC.
TREASUREHUNT = Quest player/s will need to find a location containing a stashed treasure.
AIPATROL = Quest player/s will need to clear an AI patrol. (Optional: With a special weapon).
AICAMP = Quest player/s will need to clear an AI Camp. (Optional: With a special weapon).
AIVIP = Quest player/s will need to protect and escort an AI to a certain location.
ACTION = Quest player/s will need to execute a certain Action.
CRAFTING  = Quest player/s will need to craft certain items.
"ObjectiveText"
String.

The objective text will be displayed in the quest log and quest hud when the objective is active and displayed.

"TimeLimit"
Integer.

The time limit in seconds the quest player/s has to complete this objective. This should be set and added in the quest configuration file containing this objective in its objectives array as it allows you to reuse it in other quests with different time limit values or without one.

"Active"
Boolean.

Enable/disable this objective configuration file from being loaded by the quest system.

Example Configuration:

{

    "AllowedClassNames": [],
    "ExcludedClassNames": [],
    "ExecutionAmount": 1
}
"ActionNames"
Array[String].

Class names of the action classes that will trigger this objective.

"AllowedClassNames"
Array[String].

Class names of items/entities that are allowed for this action objective. Example: If we would add the name "PotatoSeed" in here and the player would need to execute the "Plant seed" action then the objective would only be completed when the player used a "PotatoSeed" for the plant action.

"ExcludedClassNames"
Array[String].

Class names of items/entities that are not allowed for this action objective. Example: If we add the name "PotatoSeed" in here and the player would need to execute the "Plant seed" action then the objective would only be completed when the player used any seed but not when he used "PotatoSeed" for the plant action.
