"InitStockPercent"

If you have for example different color variations for an item, then you can add these items into this array and they will be displayed in a dropdown menu in the detailed market item section whenever the base item has been selected. By default a variant will take over the configuration of the base item. If you want to have a different min/max price or min/max stock threshold configuration for a variant, then it also needs its own entry in the "Items" array with the desired configuration.
If you want an item to have static (infinite) stock, set both MinStockThreshold and MaxStockThreshold to 1.

If you want an item to have static price, set both MinPriceThreshold and MaxPriceThreshold to the same value.

A list of items the trader can sell/buy. The integer value controls whether an item can be only be bought (0), bought and sold (1), or only sold (2) at this specific trader. A special value of 3 is also possible, which means the item should not be shown in the trader menu normally and is only sellable/purchasable as attachment.

        "engineoil": 2
    }
For further information please take a look at the setup guide for the trader entities/NPCs:

Trader and NPC Entities setup
All trader entities/NPCs need to be configured using .map files in the following directory:

mpmissions/dayzoffline.<MapName>/expansion/traders/MyTrader.map

If you want to use the DayZ-Expansion-AI for trader NPCs, be aware that AI traders have a higher performance impact than static NPCs.

The file is a simple text file that needs to follow our .map file format (see below).
The file name can be what ever you want.
Every trader entity/NPC needs an entry (one line per trader entity) in one or several .map files in the following format:

<TraderEntityClassName>.<TraderFileName>|<Position>|<Orientation>|<Gear>
Example:

ExpansionTraderDenis.Weapons|11833.576 140.605 12469.492|110 0 0|Jeans_Blue,TSHirt_Blue
TraderEntityClassName

This is the entity/NPC classname (in this example ExpansionTraderDenis).

Scroll down to see a list of all the default expansion trader npc's we provide.

TraderFileName

This is the trader configuration file name (in this example Weapons), without the JSON extension, that controls what the trader sells/buys. It is separated from the trader entity class name with a dot (.), much like a file extensions, but is the trader file's base name instead. The TraderFileName parameter here needs to be the same as one of the configured trader JSON files from the trader settings folder (ExpansionMod\Traders). For further information, please take a look at our Wiki page about the trader settings: https://github.com/salutesh/DayZ-Expansion-Scripts/wiki/%5BServer-Hosting%5D-Trader-Settings

trader file name showcase

Position

Either a single position vector or a list of vectors (delimited by commas ,) aka waypoints. Waypoints will only work if the entity is an AI trader.

Reminder, dayz 3d world use the Y axis as the height/elevation axis. Use tools such as dayz editor, community online tools, vanilla plus plus admin tools to get this 3d positions.



Orientation

Single vector.

The direction the trader entity/NPC will be facing.

Gear

List of items that should be in the trader entity's inventory (i.e. clothes), delimited by comma (,). Attachments on items are possible by separating them from the main item with plus signs +. E.g.

ExpansionTraderDenis.Weapons|11833.576 140.605 12469.492|110 0 0|Jeans_Blue,TSHirt_Blue,AKM+Mag_AKM_30Rnd+KobraOptic
You can use special keywords instead of or in addition to gear to influence some properties of a trader. Example to set trader name to "Mark" and use the loadout "MyTraderLoadout":

ExpansionTraderDenis.Weapons|11833.576 140.605 12469.492|110 0 0|name:Mark,loadout:MyTraderLoadout
For AI traders, you can also assign a different faction:

ExpansionTraderAIDenis.Weapons|11833.576 140.605 12469.492|110 0 0|name:Mark,loadout:MyTraderLoadout,faction:Guards

TraderZones settings
Unlike most other settings that may not be map-specific, you can find the traderzones folder in your mpmission\dayzOffline.<mapname>\expansion folder.

Traders will only act as traders if they are within the radius of a traderzone. NOTE that zones are spheres, so altitude for Position needs to be set correctly!

"m_Version"
Integer.

Contains the current setting version number, never change this value unless you really know what you are doing as it's used internally for automatic conversion of old settings whenever we change something.

"m_DisplayName"
String.

Market zone display name, can be what ever you want. Used for logging.

"Position"
Vector.

Center position of the market zone in the game world.

"Radius"
Float.

Used to define the size of the trader zone in the game world.

"BuyPricePercent"
Float.

This controls the buy price for all market items in this specific zone. By default this value is 100% of the buy price as calculated from an item's stock, min price, max price, and min/max stock thresholds (see market categories settings).

"SellPricePercent"
Float.

This controls the sell price for all market items in this specific zone. By default this value is -1.0, meaning the global value from market settings will be used, but can be overridden by setting this to the desired percentage.

"Stock"
Map<String, Integer>.

Contains all the items that can be purchased in this market zone and the current stock of each item. You can set the stock for each individual item or set it to 0 (meaning traders in this zone will only start selling the item after players have sold at least one of the respective item to the trader).
