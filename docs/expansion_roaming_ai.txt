Based on this more comprehensive transcript, here's an updated summary of the AI Patrol feature for roaming patrols, focusing on information provided by liquidrock and other confident observations:

1. Behavior: Set "Behaviour": "ROAMING" in the configuration to enable roaming AI.

2. Configuration: Settings are in AIPatrolSettings.json, located in mpmission/mapname/expansion/settings.

3. Spawn Points:
   - Only one spawn point is needed for roaming AI.
   - Multiple waypoints can be used if "UseRandomWaypointAsStartPoint" is set to 1.
   - AI will spawn at ground level on land, or on the water surface for water coordinates.

4. Movement:
   - AI will visit every location on the map if they survive long enough.
   - They might get stuck occasionally, but this should be rare.
   - After exploring the whole map, they'll revisit previously explored areas.

5. Persistency:
   - Enable with "Persist": 1 and a unique name for the patrol.
   - Persistent AI continue from their last point with all acquired gear after server restarts.
   - Persistence data is stored in mpmissions\mapname\storage_x\expansion\ai.

6. Loadout: Suggested to spawn them with minimal gear and let them acquire items themselves.

7. Respawn and Despawn:
   - RespawnTime and DespawnTime settings work for all patrols.
   - If respawn is off, they will respawn on the next server restart.

8. Area Restrictions: Currently no way to restrict roaming AI to a specific area without custom mapping.

9. Despawn Radius: Set a very large despawn radius to keep roaming AI active when no players are nearby.

10. Looting: AI can get stuck in looting loops with each other. This might be addressed in future updates.

11. Compatibility: Works with different maps, including Deer Isle.

12. Configuration Tips:
    - Ensure MinDist and MaxDist are set up sensibly.
    - Patrol names must be unique for persistence to work.
    - Spaces in names are allowed but may cause issues in some cases.

13. Future Updates: Developers might make looting a separate option from roaming in the future.

14. File Location: A file for Chernarus was provided to improve AI traversal, dealing with known map object bugs.

This feature significantly enhances AI behavior, allowing for more dynamic and unpredictable NPC interactions. The system is still being refined, and users are encouraged to experiment and provide feedback.
