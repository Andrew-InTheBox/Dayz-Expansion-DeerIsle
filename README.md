# DayZ-Expansion-DeerIsle

This repository contains the configuration files for a DayZ server setup using the DeerIsle expansion. The files are located in the `./config` and `./mpmissions/Expansion.deerisle` directories.

The setup includes:
- The Expansion bundle
- Several quests
- Multiple market traders

<<<<<<< HEAD
> **Note:** MMG equipment is integrated, but the category for market items can be removed if necessary.

## Startup Note

The startup batch file identifies any directory starting with "@" as a mod. Consequently, server-side mods must not start with "@" in their names. In this setup, server-side mods are denoted with "_XYZ". Add the ones you are using manually to the startup batch.

## Mods Used

The setup utilizes the following mods:

- **DeerIsle**
- **BulletStacksPlusEnhanced**
- **CF**
- **COT**
- **DabsFramework**
- **DayZ-Editor-Loader**
- **Dayz-Expansion-Animations**
- **DayZ-Expansion-Bundle**
- **DayZ-Expansion-Licensed**
- **MMG-MightysMilitaryGear**
- **PvZmoD_CustomizableZombies**
