# Dayz-Expansion-DeerIsle

Configuration files from ./config and ./mpmissions/Expansion.deerisle for a dayz server setup that includse Expansion bundle, several quests, and multiple market traders.  Note, MMG equipment is used, but that category for market items can be removed if needed.

##Note - the startup batch file will load any directory starting with "@" as a mod.  Server-side mods have to be named as NOT starting with @.  In my case, I used _XYZ to note serverside mods and just added the one I'm using manually to the startup batch.
